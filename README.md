The objective of this code is to simulate and compare the performance of two fraud detection models — a BERT-based model and a GAN-based model — using randomly generated predictions (dummy classifiers) on a dataset of job descriptions labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.

The code aims to:

Preprocess and balance the dataset (handling missing values and class imbalance using upsampling).

Simulate model predictions for BERT and GAN using a dummy classifier with controlled accuracy.

Compute evaluation metrics such as:

Accuracy

Recall

Sensitivity

F1-Score

G-Mean

Visualize the comparative performance of both models using a bar chart.
